Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimated resident population is based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census.\n<br><br> SUDO has ingested this dataset in its GeoPackage format.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa2_maincode_2016","type":"String","title":"SA2 Main Code 2016","description":"Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) Main Code from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) 2016","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"deaths_2020_21","type":"Integer","title":"Deaths 2020-21","description":"The permanent disappearance of all evidence of life after birth has taken place","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"births_2019_20","type":"Integer","title":"Births 2019-20","description":"The delivery of a child, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, who, after being born, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as heartbeat","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"births_2020_21","type":"Integer","title":"Births 2020-21","description":"The delivery of a child, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, who, after being born, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as heartbeat","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"deaths_2019_20","type":"Integer","title":"Deaths 2019-20","description":"The permanent disappearance of all evidence of life after birth has taken place","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"erp_2001","type":"Integer","title":"ERP 2001","description":"Estimated resident population (ERP) for 2001","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"erp_2020","type":"Integer","title":"ERP 2020","description":"Estimated resident population (ERP) for 2020","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"erp_2021","type":"Integer","title":"ERP 2021","description":"Estimated resident population (ERP) for 2021","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"erp_change_number_2020_21","type":"Integer","title":"ERP Change 2020 to 2021","description":"Estimated resident population (ERP) change from 2020 to 2021.
